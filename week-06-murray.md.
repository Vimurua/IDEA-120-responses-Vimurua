I think whats interesting is the way Murray expresses the emergent of the one technology. The way our phone, computer and TV will ultimatley merge together to create an optimal viewing experience. 
I see that often trhough different social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, Youtube, Twitter, etc... With Instagram and youtube copying popular services like the TikTok "Doom Scroll" with Instagram's "Reels" and Youtube's "Shorts". 
With The different realities featured in the Mandalorian Youtube video, I think the viewers also feel that immersion that the actors experience. Creating that layer. Im interested to see if and when that total immersion takes.
