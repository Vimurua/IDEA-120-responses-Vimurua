One of the first things I thought of when reading about the Festspielhaus, was the way Disney uses color and perspective to create an illusion of great size in their ammusment parks. When you enter Disneyland's main street, you are greeted by a vast array of colorful cartoonish buildings that seem very large. the way they achieve this is with the design.

One way design was used was with the buildings; upper stories are somewhat shorter than would be normal for a building so they seem to be taller than they are. Disney would use illusions with change in color that occurs when light travels through air, including the atmosphere, in order to make objects appear farther away or larger than they actually are. Kim Irvine, art director at Walt Disney Imagineering, explained on the Disney Parks Blog that her team "warmed the pink hues on the lower towers and gradually added blue to lighten the colors toward the top," in an effort to make the iconic Disneyland castle appear as grand as possible.

Disney, like Wagner immerses the audience through the design of the environment. Creating a feeling of immersion in a world of fantasy.
