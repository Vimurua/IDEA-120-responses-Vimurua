## Hot  
When thinking of what media might be hot, I thought about reality TV. The way the stories are created to excite and entertain the audience with minimal participation. We watch these people live their everyday lives. We accept it for what their lives are and gain enjoyment from that.

## Cold  
When I thought of what might be considered cold media was video games. I great game that came to mind was Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. This is a high speed fighting game that requires the player to be activley focused on many different things. Where they are, where the enemy is, what character you both are playing; which then leads to what moves do you both have and plan out how to win. With the amount of quick thinking, I believe this to be cold media. Requiring the audience to dig deeper to learn about movesets and game tech.
