## Hot  
When thinking of what media might be hot, I thought about reality TV.

## Cold  
When I thought of what might be considered cold media was video games. I great game that came to mind was Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. This is a high speed fighting game that requires the player to be activley focused on many different things. Where they are, where the enemy is, what character you both are playing; which then leads to what moves do you both have and plan out how to win. With the amount of quick thinking, I believe this to be cold media. Requiring the audience to dig deeper to learn about movesets and game tech.
